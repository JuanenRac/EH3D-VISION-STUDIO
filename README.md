**Honesty check - what actually runs today:** a Rust library and a command line program (`eh3d-vision`) with 66 tests that run on a computer: finds round fiducial marks in an image, turns pixels into millimetres and works out the turn and the shift that put a board where its design says. It has no window yet, it has not been tried on a machine and it has not been checked against a collection of real files.

---

> **Safety and security status:** this program does not control any machine and is not a safety system. What it produces must be checked by a person before anything is run on a machine; nothing here has run on real hardware.

## 🚦 Project status

Each line is one part of this repository and the light says how far it is today. It is written from what the repository can show (tests, builds, runs), not from what is planned.

🟢 Done and verified · 🟡 Works, with known limits · 🟠 Partly done or not verified yet · 🔴 Not done or not working

| Area | State | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| Core | 🟡 | finds round fiducial marks in an image, turns pixels into millimetres and works out the turn and the shift that put a board where its design says; tested on a computer with normal and damaged input, not with a collection of real files. |
| Command line | 🟡 | `eh3d-vision` runs the same functions as the library and prints the result; every error comes back as a message and a non-zero exit code. |
| Tests | 🟡 | 66 tests pass (`cargo test`), with normal cases, edge cases and damaged input. |
| Security | 🟡 | Plain safe Rust (`forbid(unsafe_code)`): nothing panics on the files it is given and a bad value is an error with its reason; no independent review. |
| Window | 🔴 | Planned: the egui window common to the suite; today there is only the command line. |
| Real hardware | 🔴 | Not tried: nothing here has been run on a machine. |
| Documentation | 🟡 | README in eight languages, the changelog and the two pictures drawn from `docs/`. |

## 🎯 Overview

* **The marks** (`src/fiducial.rs`): the image is cut in dark and light with the threshold of Otsu, the connected spots are measured, and the ones that are discs of the expected size (the area, the fill of the circle that holds them and how elongated they are) are the marks, the best first; a spot cut by the edge of the picture is left out because its centre cannot be trusted, and the marks can be dark on light or light on dark.
* **The scale and the lens** (`src/scale.rs`): the millimetres of a pixel come from a mark of a known size, the machine axes go up while the image goes down, and the radial distortion of the lens is recovered by least squares from a grid of marks and corrected.
* **The board** (`src/align.rs`): from two or more fiducials of the design and the same ones as the camera found them, the turn, the shift and (if allowed) the size are worked out by least squares, with the residual in millimetres; a transform whose residual is too big (a wrong mark) or whose size is off (a stretched board) is not accepted.

## 🧩 Role in EH3D

EH3D-VISION-STUDIO is one program of the EH3D Fabrication Suite. Today it works as a library and a command line; its window, in the look the other programs of the suite share, is planned. It reads and writes plain files, so it can be used on its own or between the other programs.

## 🏛️ Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/architecture.svg" alt="EH3D-VISION-STUDIO architecture: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on" width="100%">
</p>


How the parts of this repository fit together: who uses it, what it holds and what it depends on. The picture is drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and checked against the code.

## ✨ Features

* **A library and a command line:** every command of `eh3d-vision` is a function of the library, so another program of the suite can call it without starting a process.
* **Strict command line:** an option that is written wrong (`--powr`) or a word too many is an error that names it, not something to ignore; the program would otherwise make its output with the default values.
* **Tests with damaged input:** the tests also feed empty files, garbage, huge numbers and cut files, and none of them may panic.
* **No guessing:** a value that does not make sense is an error that says which value and why, never a result that only looks right.
* **No unsafe code:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in the library and the program.

## 🔒 Security & Safety

| Threat | Defense |
|---|---|
| A damaged, truncated or empty file | no panic: the tests cut valid input at every position and feed garbage |
| A number that makes no sense (negative, not finite, absurdly large) | refused with an error that names the value; nothing is rounded into something plausible |
| Unsafe memory use | plain safe Rust with `forbid(unsafe_code)` |

**What is not defended:** a result that was produced cleanly is not a verified result. Nothing here knows the limits of a machine, and the program has had no independent review. Report a vulnerability privately (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## 🔌 Interfaces

The library is `eh3d_vision_studio` (`use eh3d_vision_studio::...`); the command line is `eh3d-vision`. The commands are these; each prints its result on the standard output and reports an error on the standard error with a non-zero exit code. There is no network access.

## ⚙️ Configuration

There is no configuration file yet: what a person chooses is given as arguments of the command line (see Interfaces) and every default is written in the help of the command (`eh3d-vision help`). The fixed limits live in the code as named constants and are covered by tests.

## 🚀 Quick start

You need a stable Rust toolchain (1.75 or newer). The repository EH3D-COMMON must be cloned beside this one: the reader of pictures is taken from it by path.

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo run --release -- align examples/design.csv examples/measured.csv
```

## 🧪 Testing

The suite has 66 tests (`cargo test`, run on Windows and Linux in the CI). They check the normal cases, the edge cases and damaged input: empty files, garbage and cut files never panic. The CI also runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy` with warnings as errors and `python -I tools/ci_validate.py`.

## 🏗️ Build & Release

The version lives in `Cargo.toml` and in `eh3d.project.json`; each version has its entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). `build.bat` / `build.sh` build the program, `test.bat` / `test.sh` run the tests and `run.bat` / `run.sh` run it with a sample. Releases are published on GitHub.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Known limits

**Known limits today**

* It has no window yet: only the library and the command line exist.
* It has not been tried on a machine nor with a collection of real files, and it has had no independent review.
* It reads a picture file, not a live camera, it finds round marks only (no crosses or squares), and it has been tried on pictures drawn by the tests, not on photographs of real boards.

**Next**

* Read the live camera of the machine (EH3D-NODE-BUNGARD-AUX), find crosses and squares, try photographs of real boards and add the window with the training of new marks.
* Add the window in the look shared by the programs of the suite, in the eight languages.
* Try it with real files and with the other programs of the suite.

## 🌍 Languages

README and texts exist in English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese and European Portuguese.

## 🤝 Contributing & Community

* Before a pull request run `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` and `python -I tools/ci_validate.py`: all must pass. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* The README exists in eight languages: a change to the text is made in all eight files, and the two pictures are drawn from `docs/architecture.json` and `docs/structure.json` by `tools/make_architecture.py` and `tools/make_structure.py`.
* Report a vulnerability privately: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Questions, ideas and reports: electrohobby3d@gmail.com ([SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)).
